YapBay is refocusing on Solana after a couple months of trying other chains. Why?

- trying to work within the confines of builder programs and never-ending leaderboards is exhausting and of questionable utility
- Solana is where we have the most committed community, built when I was working at OpenPeer and developing LocalSolana v1
- all the technical advantages of Solana, the excellent liquidity, the growing ecosystem, etc.

Personally, I prefer builder support programs that encourage serving real customers, not that try to get me to change the project to suit the business needs of the given ecosystem or that sap my time with unnecessary integrations and hoops.

So we're going all in on Solana and refocusing on you, the end user.

With that said, we're not ruling out other chains, especially down the line once we build some critical mass on Solana.

## Welcome to a New Team Member

A big welcome to [Jorge Gallo](https://x.com/0xJrgeFi) who is joining us as co-founder and COO. Jorge has a background in Web3 data analysis, blockchain analytics and P2P stablecoin concepts. Together, we're going to take YapBay to a Solana mainnet beta launch, ideally with a couple grants here and there!

We have no funds right now but if you are interested in helping to make the [YapBay mission](/about/) happen, maybe you can be a co-founder as well. We welcome your ideas and feedback in our [Telegram community](https://t.me/Panmoni/288)!

Note that general marketing and community management is not something we actively need right now. I think we could always use more technical talent, bizdev talent to onboard traders one by one if need be and a content creator. Just keep in mind that payment at this time would be in gratitude, comraderie and the vague hint of potential future tokens.
