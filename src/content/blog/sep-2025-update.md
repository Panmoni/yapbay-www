We’re currently testing **version 0.1.2** of our [Solana-based escrow program](https://github.com/Panmoni/localsolana-contracts). This update brings important improvements for transparency, auditing and usability. The changes focus on **balance tracking**, **event visibility** and **sequential trade handling**. In this post, we’ll walk through what’s changed and why it matters to you as a trader, developer or integrator.

## ✨ What’s New in v0.1.2

### 1. **Tracked Escrow Balances**
- **Change:** A new field `tracked_balance` has been added to the `Escrow` account.  
- **Benefit:**  
  - This provides an authoritative, on-chain view of how much value is currently held in each escrow.  
  - Off-chain indexers, wallets and dispute resolution tools no longer need to infer balances by replaying past transfers — they can simply read the current `tracked_balance`.

**Example:**  
- When you fund an escrow, `tracked_balance` updates to reflect the deposit.  
- When funds are released, cancelled or resolved via dispute, it automatically resets to `0`.

### 2. **New Event: EscrowBalanceChanged**
- **Change:** Every major escrow action (funding, release, cancelation or dispute resolution) now emits a new event whenever the on-chain balance changes.  
- **Benefit:**  
  - Provides **real-time, stream-friendly updates** for explorers, bots and dashboards.  
  - You can easily subscribe to a single event type to track balance changes in your UI or backend.

**Event Fields:**
- `object_id` — escrow account (PDA)  
- `escrow_id` / `trade_id` — identifiers for cross-system linking  
- `new_balance` — updated tracked balance  
- `reason` — human-readable string (e.g. “Escrow funded”, “Escrow released”)  
- `timestamp` — time of the event  

This makes it much easier to build auditable transaction histories and visualize user funds across multiple trades.

### 3. **Sequential Address Updates Are Transparent**
- **Change:** Updating the sequential escrow address now emits a dedicated `SequentialAddressUpdated` event.  
- **Benefit:**  
  - In **chained trades**, everyone can see when the “next link” in an escrow sequence is updated.  
  - Builds confidence by surfacing changes that were previously only visible by inspecting state directly.  
- This ensures buyers, sellers and arbitrators all have a **clear event log** of the sequential flow.

### 4. **Dispute Workflows Track Balances Too**
- **Change:**  
  - Dispute resolution functions (`default_judgment` / `resolve_dispute_with_explanation`) now set the `tracked_balance` back to `0` once funds are moved.  
  - They also emit corresponding `EscrowBalanceChanged` events with clear reasons like “Dispute resolved to buyer” or “Dispute resolved by default judgment”.  
- **Benefit:**  
  - Eliminates ambiguity after disputes are closed: you can see exactly when the escrow was emptied and why.  
  - Adds accountability in arbitration processes.

### 5. **Improved Transparency in Auto-Cancellations**
- **Change:** Auto-cancellations now also zero-out tracked balances and emit a balance change event.  
- **Benefit:**  
  - Users no longer have to guess whether an escrow was cancelled before being funded or after — the event log makes that distinction obvious.  

## 📊 Why These Changes Matter

1. **For Traders** — You get more confidence in the platform. Every coin in escrow is accounted for with an explicit balance field and matching event trail. No hidden moves.  

2. **For Dispute Participants** — Arbitration outcomes are cleaner: funds move, balances reset and events are logged. Both winners and losers know exactly what happened on-chain.  

3. **For Developers & Integrators** — Building wallets, dashboards or bots? With tracked balances and standardized events, you can show escrow lifecycle state machines without reconstructing transaction history.  

4. **For Arbitrators** — Sequential and dispute changes now leave audit-friendly logs, making it easier to justify and verify decisions.

## 🚀 Summary

The **0.1.2 release** isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a big step towards **full transparency and user trust** in decentralized trade. With `tracked_balance`, `EscrowBalanceChanged` and `SequentialAddressUpdated` events, every token held in Escrow now leaves a clear, auditable trail.

This update lays the groundwork for richer dashboards, better arbitration tools and ultimately, safer peer-to-peer trading on Solana.  

Stay tuned — we’re not done yet. Lots more to come as we race towards a devnet MVP.
